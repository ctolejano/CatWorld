# CatWorld
Initial repository 

This is my new GitHub repository

Aside from eating lots of nachos and trying to find the best nachos around, I have a relatively mundane existence.
A classic dork, i'm into games - board, video, rpg...etc. - as well as sports and enjoy the occasional triathlon.

Always willing to share more!
